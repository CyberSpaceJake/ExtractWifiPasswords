This is a tool for extracting Wifi passwords on Windows or Linux machines. 

The script demonstrates how easy it can be to take wifi passwords that are stored in plaintext using system tools. 

To initiate this script make sure python is installed on your computer and open a command prompt/linux terminal as admin/root.
Navigate to the location of the main.py file using 'CD' commands. Once in the same folder as main.py run this line:
python main.py

The script will then determine if you are running Windows or Linux and then grab all of the SSIDs and their associated passwords. 
It will then print out the gathered information, and ask if you would like to save the data to a .csv file.
If yes, you will be prompted to name your file. It will then save in the same location that the script was ran. 

Enjoy!
